It's a world where fairies rewrite every book they touch, <br>
Where demons fill in for gods, <br>
And gods fill in for demons. <br>
Where stories are written without being read <br>
And no one can be sure which book is theirs. <br>
It has land to walk on, <br>
Gaps to fall in, <br>
And other ends to come out of. <br>
You might see humans <br>
Or you might go a lifetime without meeting one. <br>
There's art and science and even magic, <br>
But in the end it's all just rituals. <br>
44 circles of hell surround it <br>
With one witch for each. <br>
There's places where <br>
Mountains are upside down, <br>
People don't meet a second time, <br>
Half the population goes by the name of Alice, <br>
Languages are forbidden. <br>
Yet despite all that, someone, somewhere, is trying to speak the truth. <br>
