      It's a world where fairies rewrite every book they touch, <br>
      Where demons fill in for gods, <br>
      And gods fill in for demons. <br>
      Where stories are written without being read <br>
      And no one can be sure which book is theirs. <br>
      It has land to walk on, <br>
      Gaps to fall in, <br>
      And other ends to come out of. <br>
      You might see humans <br>
      Or you might go a lifetime without meeting one. <br>
      There's art and science and even magic, <br>
      But in the end it's all just rituals. <br>
      44 circles of hell surround it <br>
      With one witch for each. <br>
      There's places where <br>
      Mountains are upside down, <br>
      People don't meet a second time, <br>
      Half the population goes by the name of Alice, <br>
      Languages are forbidden. <br>
      Yet despite all that, someone, somewhere, is trying to speak the truth.<br>
